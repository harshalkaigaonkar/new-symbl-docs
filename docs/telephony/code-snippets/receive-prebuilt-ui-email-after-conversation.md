This snippet goes into detail about how to receive Symbl's Prebuilt Summary UI email after a conversation is finished. The Prebuilt Summary UI email details the conversation using speech-to-text transcription and shows any AI insights gathered during the conversation. This example uses both the [Symbl's Javascript SDK](/docs/javascript-sdk/overview/introduction) and native Javascript.

#### This is an example of the summary page you can expect to receive at the end of your call

![Summary Page](/img/summary.png)

Take a look at the <a href="https://oob-prod.rammer.ai/meeting/#/eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJzdXJiaGlyYXRob3JlQHJhbW1lci5haSIsIm5hbWUiOiJTdXJiaGkiLCJzZXNzaW9uSWQiOiI2MzA0NTA2NTcyNzAxNjk2In0" target="_blank">Sample Summary UI</a> which is generated after a meeting is concluded.

:::info
Currently, the PSTN connection requires a US phone number. You can use a SIP connection to connect to a SIP URI instead. [Learn more about how to connect using SIP](/docs/telephony/code-snippets/connect-to-sip).
:::

## Connect

When we're connecting to the Web Socket, we can define which language we use in the configuration. Take a look at the `actions` part of the configuration object. `actions` tell the API to perform an action once an event is invoked. Here we define action to send an email (`sendSummaryEmail`) after the `stop` event, which happens once a conversation is finished. The email will be sent to the emails defined in the `emails` array.

### Actions Configuration Snippet

```js
{
  "actions": [{
    "invokeOn": "stop",
    "name": "sendSummaryEmail",
    "parameters": {
      "emails": [
        "john@example.com"
      ]
    }
  }]
}
```


:::info
The <strong>Symbl SDK (Node.js)</strong> snippet must be run using Node.js, while the <strong>Native Javascript</strong> snippet can be run in your web browser.
:::

### Authentication
Before using this API, you must generate your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`). To learn how to get the authentication token, see the [Authentication](/docs/developer-tools/authentication) page.

#### Testing

Create a javascript file named `app.js` and copy this code into the file. Fill in the placeholder values with the proper values. Use npm to install the required libraries: `npm install symbl-node`. Now in the terminal run

```bash
$ node app.js
```

If successful you should receive a response in the console.

#### Testing

Create a python file named `app.py` and copy this code into the file. Fill in the placeholder values with the proper values. Use Python PIP ([learn how to install here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)) to install [Python Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (`pip install requests`). In your termninal, now run:

```bash
$ python app.py
```

If successful you should receive a response in the console.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Running this code should connect our API to your phone call. Once the call is completed you will receive an email that details the conversation and provides you with a transcription and Insights about the call.

### Response

If successful, you will receive a response in the console as shown below:

```json
{
    "eventUrl": "https://api.symbl.ai/v1/event/f31ad3b9-341a-4950-a1c2-152f08da8aaa",
    "resultWebSocketUrl": "wss://api.symbl.ai/events/f31ad3b9-341a-4950-a1c2-152f08da8aaa",
    "conversationId": "5687907911204864",
    "connectionId": "f31ad3b9-341a-4950-a1c2-152f08da8aaa"
}
```
### Response Parameters

Field | Description
---------- | ------- |
```eventUrl``` | REST API to push speaker events as the conversation is in progress, to add additional speaker context in the conversation. Example - In an on-going meeting, you can push speaker events.
```resultWebSocketUrl``` | Same as `eventUrl` but over WebSocket. The latency of events is lower with a dedicated WebSocket `connection.ct`.
```connectionId``` | Ephemeral connection identifier of the request, to uniquely identify the telephony connection. Once the connection is stopped using “stop” operation, or is closed due to some other reason, the `connectionId` is no longer valid.
```conversationId``` | Represents the conversation - this is the ID that needs to be used in conversation API to access the conversation.

### Stop Connection 

The following response is returned with the Summary UI `url` when you stop the connection. 

```json
{
    "eventUrl": "https://api.symbl.ai/v1/event/f31ad3b9-341a-4950-a1c2-152f08da8aaa",
    "resultWebSocketUrl": "wss://api.symbl.ai/events/f31ad3b9-341a-4950-a1c2-152f08da8aaa",
    "summaryInfo": [
        {
            "user": {
                "id": "c2585d65-c6c1-4108-a6be-71988c46e77d",
                "userId": "john@example.com",
                "name": "John",
