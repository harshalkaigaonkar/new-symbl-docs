Based on PSTN and SIP protocols, the Telephony API provides an interface for the developers to have Symbl bridge/join VoIP calls and get the results back in real-time as well. Optionally, you can also trigger an email at the end of the conversation containing the URL to view the transcription, insights and topics in a single page Web Application.
