:::note In Beta Phase
This feature is in the Beta phase. If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please reach out to us at devrelations@symbl.ai.
:::

Symbl provides a set of Async APIs based on audio, video or text content. For more details on Async APIs refer to the documentation [here](/docs/async-api/introduction). 

The Trackers once ingested via the request, will then try to detect these in the Conversation. Once the job is complete, you can fetch the Trackers from the Conversation API through the `/trackers` endpoint described below.

:::info Creating Trackers with Management API
While you can create Trackers with Async or Streaming APIs, it is recommended that you create Trackers using Management API because Trackers created with Management APIs are saved and can be reused while the same is not possible with Async or Streaming APIs. 
:::

### Async Audio File API
The Tracker entities should be passed as a **query parameter** in the Async Audio API’s URL as shown below.

:::tip
- Before creating the Trackers, go through the [Best Practices](/docs/best-practices/best-practices-trackers/) document to learn about the dos and don'ts of the Tracker vocabulary creation.

- If you want to create multiple trackers, use [Trackers Management API for bulk creation](/docs/management-api/trackers/create-tracker#create-trackers-in-bulk). The Trackers Management API handles all the Trackers you have created at your account level and makes it easy to maintain them.
:::

#### Authentication 

Before using the API, ensure that you have your Authentication Token (`AUTH_TOKEN`) handy. To learn about how to get your auth token, see the step-by-step instructions on the [Authentication](/docs/developer-tools/authentication) page.

### API Endpoint
