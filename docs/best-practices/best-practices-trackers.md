Some of the best practices to keep in mind while creating the Trackers vocabulary are given below:

## Using Keywords 

**Dos** <br/>
Densely pack the vocabulary with keywords. Each keyword should add meaning to the sentence.
For example, using “subscription fees” is a good practice because both the words “subscription” and “fees” contain keywords.

**Don’ts** <br/>
Do not preface a keyword with words that don’t add meaning.
For example, using “Could you please kindly inform me about your subscription fees?” is not a good vocabulary item because the first part of the sentence conveys very little information. Only the last two words in the sentence contain useful information, which is “subscription fees”.


## Sentence Structure

**Dos** <br/>
Structure the sentences in a simple way avoiding words that do not add to the meaning. 
For example, “I can’t afford this” is a simple sentence where all the four words contribute to the meaning. 

**Don’ts**<br/>
Do not use complex sentence structures that do not add meaning such as “I think”,  “I feel”, etc.
For example, “I am thinking that I can’t afford this”. Here, the words “I am thinking that ” do not contribute to the meaning of this sentence since “I can’t afford this” is the key meaning of this sentence. 

## One meaning per vocabulary phrase 

**Dos**<br/>
Each phrase in the vocabulary should convey only one meaning. 
For example, 
“I used to like chocolate” and “I don’t like chocolate anymore” are conveying two different meanings and are constructed as different phrases. 

**Don’ts**<br/>
Do not use two different meanings or thoughts in a single phrase.  
For example, 
“I used to like chocolate, but I don’t anymore”.  This vocabulary phrase is combining two meanings into one sentence and is not a good practice.
