## Getting Started with Symbl
### Step 1. Get API Credentials
---

Sign up on the [Symbl Platform](https://platform.symbl.ai/#/login) and grab your API Credentials. <br/>
Using the Symbl credentials, you can [generate the authentication token](/docs/developer-tools/authentication) that you can use everytime you make Symbl API calls. 
&nbsp;

### Step 2. Send Recorded Conversation OR Connect Live
---

Using the APIs given below, send conversation data in real-time or after the conversation has taken place (async) i.e., with recorded data. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Async APIs](/docs/async-api/introduction) allow you to send text, audio, or video conversations in recorded format. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Streaming APIs](/docs/streamingapi/introduction) allow you to connect Symbl on a live call via WebSocket protocol.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Telephony APIs](/docs/telephony/introduction) allow you to connect Symbl on a live audio conversation via SIP and PSTN.<br/>

### Step 3. Get Conversation Intelligence
---

In Step 2, the `conversationId` is returned. Use the Conversation ID in the **Conversation API** to generate Symbl's Conversation Intelligence and insights:

&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Speech-to-Text (Transcripts)](/docs/concepts/speech-to-text)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Topics](/docs/concepts/topics) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Sentiment Analysis](/docs/concepts/sentiment-analysis) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Action Items](/docs/concepts/action-items)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Follow-Ups](/docs/concepts/follow-ups)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Questions](/docs/concepts/questions)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Trackers](/docs/concepts/trackers)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Conversation Groups](/docs/concepts/conversation-groups)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Conversation Analytics](/docs/concepts/conversational-analytics)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; [Get Topic Hierarchy](/docs/concepts/topic-hierarchy)<br/>

 ... and more.
