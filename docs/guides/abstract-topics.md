Abstract Topics are topics that at a glance help you determine recurrent themes in a conversation.

#### Example

- Conversation on topics such as pricing, negotiation, sales representative, etc., are abstracted to **Sales**.

- Conversation on coughing, cold, fever, chills, chest pain, etc., are abstracted to **Covid-19 Symptoms**.

:::note
Currently, Abstract Topics are not supported in real-time.

## Abstract Topics API

To get abstract topics, you must first process your conversation using [Async APIs](/docs/async-api/introduction). After you process the conversation, you will receive a Conversation ID which you must pass in the [Abstract Topics API](/docs/api-reference/abstract-topics).
