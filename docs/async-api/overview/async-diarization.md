The Async Audio & Async Video APIs can detect and separate unique speakers in a single stream of audio & video without need of separate speaker events.

To enable this capability with either of the APIs the `enableSpeakerDiarization` and `diarizationSpeakerCount` query parameters need to be passed with the request.

The `diarizationSpeakerCount` should be equal to the number of unique speakers in the conversation. If the number varies then this might introduce false positives in the diarized results.

If youâ€™re looking for similar capability in Real-Time APIs, please refer to [Active Speaker Events](/docs/javascript-sdk/code-snippets/active-speaker-events) and Speaker Separation in WebSocket API sections.

:::info Speaker Diarization Language Support

Currently, Speaker Diarization is available for English and Spanish languages only.
