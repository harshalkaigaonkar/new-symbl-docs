:::note In Beta Phase
This feature is in the Beta phase. If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please reach out to us atÂ devrelations@symbl.ai.
:::

## Process video file

The first thing you need to do before you start tracking phrases in a conversation is to process your conversation. This code is taken directly from our [POST Video URL](/docs/async-api/overview/video/post-video-url) page. If you want to use an audio or text conversation you can use the code from the [POST Audio URL](/docs/async-api/overview/audio/post-audio-url) or [POST Text](/docs/async-api/overview/text/post-text) pages.

While we provide you with a default textual conversation for the API to process you can replace that with any other conversation.

:::caution
You must wait for the job to complete processing before you proceed with getting the Conversation Intelligence. If you immediately make a GET request to Conversation API, it is possible that you'll receive incomplete insights. Therefore, ensure that you wait for the job to complete.
:::

### Authentication
Before using this API, you must generate your authentication token (`AUTH_TOKEN`). To learn how to get the authentication token, see the [Authentication](/docs/developer-tools/authentication) page.

## View Detected Trackers

In the response above, you will notice the `conversationId` field. Using the `conversationId` you can send a request to [GET Trackers](/docs/conversation-api/trackers) endpoint in the [Conversation API](/docs/conversation-api/introduction), which will give you a list and information about the detected trackers in the conversation.

**[View conversation topics](/docs/conversation-api/get-topics)**<br />
Summary topics provide a quick overview of the key things that were talked about in the conversation.

**[View action items](/docs/conversation-api/action-items)**<br />
An action item is a specific outcome recognized in the conversation that requires one or more people in the conversation to take a specific action, e.g. set up a meeting, share a file, complete a task, etc.

**[View follow-ups](/docs/conversation-api/follow-ups)**<br />
This is a category of action items with a connotation to follow-up a request or a task like sending an email or making a phone call or booking an appointment or setting up a meeting.
