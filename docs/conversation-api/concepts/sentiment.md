Sentiment Analysis is the interpretation of the general thought, feeling, or sense of an object or a situation.

Symbl's Sentiment API works over Speech-to-Text sentences and Topics (or aspect).

## Sentiment API

To see Sentiment API in action, you need to process a conversation using Symbl. After you process a conversation, you'll receive a **conversation Id** which can be passed in below-mentioned Conversation APIs. All you need to do is pass query parameters `sentiment=true`.

:::info
Each continuous sentence spoken by a speaker in conversation is referred to as a Message. **Hence ,we named our Speech to Text API as Messages API**. Messages API returns you a list of messages in a conversation.
:::

### ðŸ‘‰[Messages API](/docs/conversation-api/messages)

:::info
For topic level, the sentiment is calculated over the topic messages scope i.e. it factors in the sentiment of messages where the topic was talked about.
