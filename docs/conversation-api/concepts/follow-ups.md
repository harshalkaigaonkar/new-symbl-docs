Symbl recognizes if an action item has a connotation or nature of language, which requires following up in general or by someone in a conversation.

#### For Example,

* *"I will sync up with my manager and find out the agreed dates with the vendor".* Here, a person needs to follow up with their manager in order to complete this action.

* *‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to set up a meeting with the design team to find out more details‚Äù.* Here, they need to organize and schedule a meeting with the design team, which indicates that there are things required to be followed upon.

* *‚ÄúI will probably sync up with you tomorrow on this‚Äù.* Here, it‚Äôs clear that there needs to be a follow-up, but the tonality doesn‚Äôt indicate whether it is the final decision, it just indicates the possibility of a sync up the next day.

* *‚ÄúI may have to schedule a meeting with the client to discuss this further‚Äù.* Here, although there needs to be further discussion with the client on the matter, it is still not clear whether that will be set up to not.


## Follow Ups API

To see Follow Ups API in action, you need to process a conversation using Symbl. After you process a meeting, you'll receive a **Conversation ID**. A Conversation ID is the key to receiving conversational insights from any conversation. As an example, here's a simple API call which grabs the detected follow-ups from the conversation.

üëâ [Follow Ups API](/docs/conversation-api/follow-ups)

### Grab follow-ups

Remember to replace the `conversationId` in the API call with the Conversation ID you get from the previous API call.
