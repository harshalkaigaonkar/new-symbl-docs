The **Comprehensive Action Items API** is similar to the Action Items API, except that the Comprehensive Action Items API returns a rephrased form of the original action item message, that's enriched with its corresponding context.

While both are equally powerful in providing Action Items that relate to a discussion, the Comprehensive Action Items API is designed to provide more details such as references to speaker names, context in which the action item was mentioned and an overall comprehensive description of the action items. 

You can use the Action Items API if you wish to relate a message one-to-one with an action item and use the exact sentence from a transcript, or utilize the Comprehensive Action Items API if you require more context to be sent alongwith the original action item, in a comprehensive format.

#### Examples 
 |  | 
| --------- | --------- 
**Returned by Action Items API** | *"So I will go ahead and I will set up a discussion with product."*
**Returned by Comprehensive Action Items** | *"John and Kay need to shift their focus more towards dev. Kay will go ahead and set up a discussion with product."*|
