Conversation Groups allow you to create groups of conversations by setting the grouping criteria that suits your business requirement.

The criteria of the group can be applied to the Conversation Metadata that can be any important information such as unique identifiers like agentId, customerId, userId, etc., or custom tags such as sales call, support call, internal discussion, etc. 

#### Examples

- *Dan is the Head of Sales in his company and wishes to group calls based on the type, such as internal and external. Using the metadata label: “Internal'' and “External”, Dan can group conversations and query all conversations using this criterion.*

- *Ashna manages the Customer Experience team and wants to manage conversations with vendor companies individually. Since there are over 10 vendor companies they work with, using Conversation Groups (that adds metadata with the company name), Ashna can separate out conversations for each vendor.*


- *Tom is the Chief Quality Assurance Manager and wants to see the customer conversations of his team member- John to analyze his discussions with the customers. He creates a metadata label with agent names (e.g., "agentId": "johndoe") that groups conversations based on the name of the agent and allows Tom to fetch all conversations made by John.*
