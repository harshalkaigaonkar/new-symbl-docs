The Conversation API provides a REST API interface for getting your processed Speech to Text data(also known as Transcripts) and Conversational Insights.

To view insights about a conversion, you must provide the API with a Conversation ID.

### What's a Conversation ID?

When you process any conversation through Symbl whether it's from [Async API](/docs/async-api/overview/introduction), [Javascript SDK](/docs/javascript-sdk/overview/introduction), [Python SDK](/docs/python-sdk/overview), [Telephony](/docs/telephony/introduction) or [Streaming API](/docs/streamingapi/overview/introduction), you'll always receive a unique Conversation ID (`conversationId`), which consists of numerical digits.
