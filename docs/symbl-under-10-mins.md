title: Extracting Speech to Text & Conversational Action Items from an audio file
---

In this guide, we will show you how to use Postman, an API collaboration tool, to extract Speech to Text & Conversational Action Items from audio.


### Get started in 3 easy steps:

1. Get Symbl Authentication üîê
2. Submit your Audio file üé§
3. Receive Speech to Text & Conversational Action Items üéÅ

#### Overview
We are going to use the [Async API](/docs/async-api/overview/introduction) to upload the audio file. After processing the request, we will get a Conversation ID, and will use this Conversation ID in the Conversation‚Äôs Message API & Insight API for receiving data.

#### Install Postman
Here‚Äôs our magical Postman link which will surface our API collection.

:::info
After clicking the run in postman button, please select Postman for Windows/Mac option only.

## Step 1: Symbl Authentication üîê

#### Retrieve your credentials

Before we can begin processing your file, you will need to retrieve your credentials. Your credentials consist of your `appId` and `appSecret`. You can find them on the [home page of the platform](https://platform.symbl.ai/).

#### Steps:

1. After you have clicked on the Postman link provided above. Click on **Authentication** folder on the left.

2. Click on **Generate Token(Authenticate)** option and you‚Äôll be able to see the API. Inside the **Body** tab, you‚Äôll see `appID` and `appSecret`.  

3. Paste your credentials([from platform homepage](https://platform.symbl.ai/)), click Send, and you should see `accessToken` (like in the image below) generated. This token is automatically copied to all other APIs in Postman. So, you don't need to copy this Token.

## Step 2: Submit your Audio file üé§

#### Overview

To upload your audio file, you have to use the [Async Audio API](/docs/async-api/overview/audio/post-audio). This API takes your audio file and processes it. After processing it, it gives you a Conversation ID as a unique ID for your audio file and a Job ID for tracking the audio processing job.

#### Steps:
1. Inside your Postman app, click on **Async APIs** and then click on **Audio ‚Äì Submit New Audio**. This will open the Async Audio API.

2. Please [click here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1-NAp9skycv2_c8iVM6Rd91vSMONAeClF) to download an audio file if you don‚Äôt have one handy. This file `business_meeting.mp3` is provided for ease of testing.

3. Once the audio file downloads, click on **Headers** and change the value of `Content-Type` to `audio/mpeg`.

4. Click on the **Body** section. Then click on **Select File** and choose the file `business_meeting.mp3` or whichever file you wish to use. Click Send and in 30 or so seconds, you‚Äôll receive the `conversationId`.

## Step 3: Receive Speech to Text & Conversational Action Items üéÅ

After you receive the `conversationId` in the response, you can now use the GET Conversation‚Äôs Messages API to receive Speech to Text for it.


### Receiving Speech to Text

In Postman Collection (on the left hand side) select **Conversation API**, in the expanded view click on **Get Messages** and press Send. And you should be able to see Speech to Text data in API response. The `conversationId` is automatically picked up from the Async Audio API response.

If you don‚Äôt see any results when you click send, give the system 1 minute to process and click on send again.

### Receiving Action Items

In the **Conversation API** tab in Postman, click on **Get Action Items** and press Send. This way you‚Äôll be able to see the action items from the audio clip you uploaded. If you want to know more about action items and APIs like it, [click here](/docs/conversation-api/introduction).
